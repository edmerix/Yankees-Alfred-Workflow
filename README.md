# Yankees Alfred Workflow

Workflow for Alfred V2 that uses the MLB API to check info about a current Yankees game (i.e. quickly check the score, who's on base, who's pitching etc.)

Shows runners on base at a glance using icons in the Alfred response, see [screenshots](#screenshots) below.

If a game has already finish today it'll show the final result, including R|H|E, if a game is scheduled for today it'll give upcoming info.
